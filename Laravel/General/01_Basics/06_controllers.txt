Controller is the link between all laravel components, 
    it request the user requests and act with it, then he respond with them, 
    it deals with the DB, either using ORM, or using DB query builder.
    it can respond with returning data to user, returned data can be: 
    1- Html (for browsers) 2- json format (for mobiles) 3- XML.

Each object in your project should have a specific controller, to Fetch it's data and deal with it's logic, 
    [Categories, Products, Photos, Users, Orders, Cart, ...etc]

Controllers Contains Logic and Calculations in the System,
    -don't use Call Back Route except you need it.
    -also don't write any Logic or Calculations in the view, for the next reasons: 
        1- To reuse the view template without alot of modifications. 
        2- To send data to the various views,
            suppose u write some Calculations in the web view,
            then the mobile app developer must write them in his application,
            some problems can appear like: Different results between web and mobile.
        
        Write all logic and Calculations in an action in a controller and send it to all views, 
        unless it was simple Calculations, like sum 2 numbers, let them do it.

Each task has it's own Controller to perform it's actions, 
    -Controller method will be performed when we call it's route, 
    -it take the parameters using request() or $request.

    -Controller fetch the data from DB using ORM or Qurey Builder
    -and then pass it to the view using COMPACT().
