Validate the request BEFORE any thig in the controller, 
    to validate the sending data, before doing any action, 
    if the sending data isn't right, redirect to the form with the error messeges.


[The easiest way] to validate a request, is to validate the request data that is send, 
    $request->validate([
            'name'=>'required',
            'phone'=>'required',
            'photo'=>'required| mimes:jpg,bmp,png',
            
            'email'=>'required',
            'password'=>'required|confirmed',
    ]);
    take care that the $request variable will hold the data that pass from validation process...
    In the last way: if the validate fails, it will redirect user to the last page automatically
    so, we can't use it with api validations

[Other Way]:



In the UNIQUE attribute: 
    if the name of the field as same as the name of the coloumn in the table in DB.
    you don't have to write the coloumn name.
