When you fetch any data in the query, try to filter it in the query to use it directly in the view, 
    do NOT fetch the whole table and it's relatoins and then loop in all this query in the View.

What is the better? 
    fetch 10000 record and store them in RAM,
        and make a condition in the loop to choose who is the propper to display in the view?

    or to fetch 400 record and loop on them in the View directly? (it's better in the speed and memory)

Try to fetch a customized data as it is possible....
