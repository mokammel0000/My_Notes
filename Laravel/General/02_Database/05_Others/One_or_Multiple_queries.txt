Each Query consume some time and memory to be excecuted, 
    so it is better to fetch all data in one query,

But in some situation, Fetching all data in one query will be exhausted operation, 
    it will consume much memory to store the whole data when it's fetched, 
    also you have to loop on the whole query in the View.

So, always compare what is the best practice in the current state?

for example: 
    we can return a product with it's all relations(comments, ratings, categories, photos, ...) in one query
    and we can seperate each relation in one query, 
        return product comments in a specefic query that returned data to a $comments variable,
        then compact this variable and use it in the view directly, 
        and do the same operation with each one of the relations...



In some situations: not each product will contain a comment, 
    then it will be useless operation to loop on 10000 record of products to show the comments on 40 of them,
    so, it's better to return comments in a specefic query.

Note that: 
    in one query you can fetch data from one table, and fetch multiple relations with it
    but you can't fetch data from multiple tables
        (in this case you have to create multiple queries -one for each table-).
