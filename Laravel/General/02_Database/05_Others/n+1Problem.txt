N+1 problem occures when u write a query in a loop,
    that causes a load on the server(bunch of requests), 
    u can get rid of that by call the query once in the controller, and loop on the result.

    in the controller, u can call the query,
                       also u can fetch it's relationships using(with()/ load()).


    
note that: 
    -u can use a function that is call a query in it, SO
        [don't loop on a query, or in a function that contains a query.]
