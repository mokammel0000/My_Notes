    1- using Query Builder:
        write the table's name.
    2- using ORM:
        but in this case you have to create a model for this table.


Fetching data from Pivot table, you have 2 ways: 
    1- using Query Builder:
        consider the pivot table like any table in the DB, and write it's name.
    2- using ORM: 
        this can be done in two ways: 
            1- create specific model for the pivot table.
            2- fetch the pivot table data with any one of the 2 tables he centered(using relations)
                do that if you will need the original table data.
