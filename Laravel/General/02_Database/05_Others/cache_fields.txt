How can we calculate how many time the product has been sold? 
    we can loop on each product on the oreders table and add one if it matches our needed product.

this is a common problem, some times we need to loop on a big number of records to calculate a specific value.

there is a common solution for It, 
    we can create a cache field / cache column that's updated continously
    in the previous example: create a column that's name is number_of_sales
    and increment it's value each time that an order is saled with this product, 
    then: when you need to calculate the number of sales of this product, 
        you haven't to loop on orders yet, it's ready...
        also you can use it in any other place
            (e.g. showing how many times this product has been sold in the product page).
