If u use a relation to make any operation, then laravel will pass the ID of this relation automatically, 
in this example: 
    auth()->user()->cart->products()->updateExistingPivot(
        #auth()->user()->id,
        $request['product_id'], 
        ['quantity'=> $newQuantity]
    );
    u haven't to send user_id, although it is not a nullable value, 
    because laravel do that for u, it send user_id because u add a value from a user relation.
