    -Fetch data from DB.
    -make operation on the DB: insert - upsert - update - delete - 
                               increment/ decrement a column - truncate table


Dumping a query before execute it: -to see what is the returning results-
    DB::table('users')->where('votes', '>', 100)->dd();    
    DB::table('users')->where('votes', '>', 100)->dump();
