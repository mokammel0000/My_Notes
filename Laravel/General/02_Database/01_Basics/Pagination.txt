If u want to display some items in a page, u will compact it from Controller to the view, aren't u?
what if this data was too much data (like 70.000 record must be compacted), 
    they will be sended them to user in one page,
    also it will consume browser's ram (how can he load these data to show it to the user)???

It's better to send data in different stages, to make it easier to user and browser.

You can use paginagion using: -query builder.
                              -ORM.

when u paginate a query, it returns with multiple variables u can use: 
perPage: 10
    -currentPage: 1
    -path: "http://localhost:8000/category/1"
    -query: []
    -fragment: null
    -pageName: "page"
    -onEachSide: 3
    -total: 13
    -lastPage: 2


don't forget {{$products->links()}} to show the numbered list at the end ot the page.





Importaaaaaaaaaant Noooooooooote: 
    the HTML generated by the paginator is compatible with the Tailwind CSS framework;
    however, Bootstrap pagination support is also available.
    u can change it form [App/provider/Appserviceprovider/write'Paginator::useBootstrapFour();'in the boot method].
