Seeder enables u to seed some data in DB,
    -u specify which table u will seed data into it, and the number of records that will be seeded.
    -u can create a new seeder to each Model, or u can use the DataBaseSeeder Class to seed data into any table.
    eg. seeding Administrator data in the users table.

Important Note: don't manually add records to the DB tables, that will done in your own device, 
    but your project members will not see that, use seeder to do that automatically.
