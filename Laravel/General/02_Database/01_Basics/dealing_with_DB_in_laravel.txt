1- create the DB, and put it's name in the .env file. 

2- use Migrations to build the tables(DDL).
    create table - drop table - alter table - 
    add column - delete column - modify column.

3- use ORM/ Query Builder to deal with them(DML).
    Select/ Read data - Add/ Create data - Update data - Delete data.


    -Using them u don't write sql code,
    u create with DB using traditional OOP code(objects, methods and variables).

then u can use seeder to add dummy data to the tables, 
also u can use factory to make the data that u want.
