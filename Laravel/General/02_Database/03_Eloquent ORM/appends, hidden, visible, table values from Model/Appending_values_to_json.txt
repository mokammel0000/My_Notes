Model see table attributes as a variables, what if we need to add a new variabel to it?!!!

In the DB tables there are attributes, when using ORM We deal with table using Model, 
    we can deal with the table attributes using the $fillable array, 

ORM enables you to create your own attributes in the Model,
    and u can deal with this attribute as the table attributes.

eg. 
    featured_photo attribute: 
        this attribute returns the first photo of the product if it has more than one photo, 
        also it returns the placeholder photo if the product has no photos in it's table.
    price_with_sign_attribute: 
        return the price value from the DB, and add a $ to it, to show the price with it's sign in all pages.

IT'S hard to do this operations every time u need them in the controller or in the view,
    (like adding $ every time u call the price, what if we need to replace $ with SAR)
    if u want to change something in the attribute, u don't have to go to all views that show the attribute, 
    u can edit it's function in the Appendig_values_to_Json and then it will be modified in all the views.
    
    so it's better to do this one in the Model, and retreive this attribute when u need it(as the real attributes).


Code: // TAKE CARE OF THE NAMES: 
    protected $appends = ['is_admin'];
    protected function isAdmin(): Attribute
    {
        return new Attribute(
            get: fn () => 'yes',
        );
    }
