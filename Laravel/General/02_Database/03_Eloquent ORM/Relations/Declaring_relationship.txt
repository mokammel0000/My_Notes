Take care: don't define a relationship unless:
    1- There exist a real relation between the 2 tables in the DB (primary key and foreign key OR pivot table). 
    2- U will need to call this relationship, 
        In some cases, u will NOT define the relationship in the Model(because u don't need it),
            eg. Is It Important to define a user relation in the cart? 
            Are u going to call the user who have this cart? 
                ut the relation must be defined because it's critical to define the cart relation in the User Model.


Tabel can have relation/ relations with other tables, 
    In ORM we deal with the table using the Model, so Model can have relation/ relations with other Models. 


Declaring the relationship in the Model: 
    belongsTo       : when you define a one to many relationship in the child side
    hasmany         : when you define a one to many relationship in the parent side
    belongsToMany   : when you define a many to many relationship in the child side
        [if there is a pivot table, you have to declare it's pivots when you declare the relation]
