Using the relationship as a [ATTRIBUTE]: 
    write the relation withoute ()
    examples: 
        $product->category;
        $product->photos
    [accesses the value of a property directly]
        this means we want to return all the data in the relation
        if there are 10 photos in the photos table, it will be returned here.

    
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Using the relationship as a [METHOD]: 
    write the relation with ()
    calls a method defined within the model,
    examples:
        $product->category();
        $product->photos() 
    [that may return a relationship or perform specific operations related to the photos attribute.]
        this means we want to return an object about the relation, 
        we can use this object to represent some meta-data like: 
            [number of records, or somethig else that you specify]
