ONE TO ONE relationship     1 : 1 + 1 : 1   
    [parent-child relation]
    [Parent has ONLY ONE child, and child relate to JUST one parent]
    
    -In the DB scheme:
        the parent has no need to store id of his child,
        the child must have his parent's id as a foreign key, 
            (note that: each foreign key can refer to just one unique primary key,
                        because the parent can't have more than one child).
        Just take the id from the parent's record and put it in the child's record.
     
    -Methods in the Model:
        The parent [hasOne()] child,
        The child [belongsto()] ONE parent.
                        // don't define the relation in the 2 Models until u need it,

    -eg.
        user hasOne() cart, in the same time the cart belongsto() just one user.
        user hasOne() phone, in the same time the phone belongsto() one user.
                -we suppose that the phone is a separated table(contains all data that belongs to phone number).
