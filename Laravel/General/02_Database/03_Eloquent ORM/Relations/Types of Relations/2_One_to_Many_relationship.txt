ONE TO Many relationship    1 : M + 1 : 1   
    [parent-child relation]
    [parent has any number of children, while child has only one parent]
    
    -In the DB scheme:
        the parent has no need to store id of his children,
        the child must have his parent's id as a foreign key,
            (note that: each foreign key can refer any primary key,
                        because the parent can have more than one child).
        Just take the id from the parent record and put it in the child record.
             

    -Methods in the Model:
        The parent [hasmany()] childs, 
        The child [belongsto()] ONE parent.
                    // don't define the relation in the 2 Models until u need it,

    -eg. 
        category hasmany() products, at the same time product belongsto() ONE category, 
        product hasmany() photos, at the same time product belongsto() ONE product.



code: 
    $comments = Post::find(1)->comments;       // find all comments that's belongsto the post that has id = 1.
    $comment = Post::find(1)->comments()->where('title', 'foo')->first();

    

    #The reverce process: 
    $comment = Comment::find(1);               // find the comment that has id = 1, 
    return $comment->post->title;              // retreive it's post's title.
