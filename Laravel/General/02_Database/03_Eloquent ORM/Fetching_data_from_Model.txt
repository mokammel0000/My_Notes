[Take care: you can create the query in multiple lines, then in the last line fetch the real data...]

Fetching data with it's Relations: 
    take care, before u can use with() or load() methods, you have to define the relations in the Model...
    
    -use with() when u fetch the Model and it's relations in the same line:
    $products = Product::with('category')->get();
    $products = Product::with(['category', 'photos'])->get(); 

    -use load() when u call the relation after Fetching the Model(
        u fetch the model previously or laravel fech it for u):
    $products->load('category');
    $products->load(['category', 'photos']);



Fetching data under some conditions:
    $products = Product::where('active', 1)->get();

    $products = Product::whereNull('is_admin')->get();
    $products = Product::where('photo', '!=', 'null')->get();
    $products = Product::whereNotNull('photo')->get();

    
    $products = Product::whereDate()->get();
    $products = Product::whereDatebetween()->get();
    


Fetching data with some modifications:
    $products = Product::orderBy('views', 'desc')->get();
    $products = Product::orderBy('views', 'desc')->limit(10)->get();

    $products = Product::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get();
    $products = Product::latest()->get();
    $products = Product::oldest()->get();
    
    

The last Step: Fetching data from The Model:
    $products = Product::all();           // get all results 
    $products = Product::get();
    $products = Product::paginate(10);    // get the results 10 by 10
    $products = Product::find($id);       // fetch a specific product
    $products = Product::dd();            // dumping the query
