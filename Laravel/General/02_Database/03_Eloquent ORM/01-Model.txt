There is an unlegall relation between Model and Controller, 
    -we create a specific controller for each route in the project(not all models).
    -controller has the actions/ handllers that will be done in the Model
        (index - show - store - update - destroy), 
    -u can reuse the model and it's controller in other projects(SOC).

Properties in the Model: 
    protected $connection = 'sqlite';
    
    protected $table = 'my_flights';

    protected $primaryKey = 'flight_id';
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $keyType = 'string';

    public $timestamps = false;
    protected $dateFormat = 'U';
    const CREATED_AT = 'creation_date';
    const UPDATED_AT = 'updated_date';

    protected $attributes = [
        'options' => '[]',
        'delayed' => false,
    ];

    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 
        'age', 
        'phone' 
    ];
    # to enable bulk saving/ mass asseignment.

    protected $guarded = [];
    
    # to use Mass Assignment in you code, add $fillable array or $guarded array and add the fields 
    # that is will be added in the array that will be passed to ORM methods(create - update).

    # fillable or guarded must be added in the Model,these properties are required because
    # all Eloquent models are protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities by default.
