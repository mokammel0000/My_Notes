Model Binding: 
    Binding Route with it's record in the Model,
        then u don't need to find() the record in the controller.


eg. 
    use App\Models\User;
    
    Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
        return $user->email;
    });

Note that: 
    the Model name that u write in the parameter, must be similar to the Model name in the Route
    in other words: 
        u can't do that: 
            #Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $theUser) {
            #    return $theUser->email;
            #});
        Laravel can't bind the model variable on the route with the parameter in the action.
