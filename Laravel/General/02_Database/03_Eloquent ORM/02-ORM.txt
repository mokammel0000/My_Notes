ORM:
    DML for the DB in Laravel.
    stands for: Object Relational Mapper.
    a design pattern, each framework give it a special name, 
        laravel named it: [Eloquent ORM].

ORM is a DML that can Select/ Insert/ Update/ Delete/ data from DB,
    Instead of write mysql code, we can use ORM to manipulate with DB using traditional classes and methods.

ORM applys MVC pattern, it deals with DB through MODEL,
    Model is the object that u call to deal with the table from it.

ORM is based on query builder... [Each Eloquent model serves as a query builder]
    # It's better to use query builder than using ORM if u want to make a complex relationships.

Use ORM in the simple queries,
    if u want to write a complex queries(like joins & calculations on Columns),
    ORM will be very complex and low performance way to deal with, 
    then u can use Expressions in the query builder(It enables you to write MYSQL commands).
