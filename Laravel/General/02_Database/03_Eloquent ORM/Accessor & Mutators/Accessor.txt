Accessor = GETTER
In ORM, we deal with the table using the Model, we can fetch or store data from the table using the Model, 
    what if we want to fetch data but adding some operations on it after fetching it? 
Accessor Allowing u to FETCH data from table, but with some modifications, to fetch it in an better format.


in a simple way: do some modifications in the value after fetching it from it's table, 
    but u don't do these modifications in the controller, u receive the value from the table as it is,
    and the model: make these modifications then return the value for u...
eg. 
    when u fetching the price: put the ($) next to the value.
        -take care: in the price case don't do that, u can make calculations on it...
            so don't make it a string value.
    -when u fetching the price: add the (VAT) to it-here we do some calculations on the price-.

Note that: 
    To avoid changing the original value after fetching it,
        u can use [Appending_values_to_json] to add a new attribute, 
        in this case u can use the original one, and the modified one.
