Mutator = Setter. 
In ORM, we deal with the table using the Model, we can fetch or store data from the table using the Model, 
    what if we want to store data but do some operations on it before storing? 
Mutator Allowing u to Store data In the table, but with some modifications, to store it in an better format.

in a simple way: do some operations in the value before storing it in it's table, 
    but u don't do these operations in the controller, u send the value from the controller as it is,
    and in the model: make these operations and store the value....

eg. 
    -Adding SKU when we add a product to products table, so user haven't to add the SKU with the input data.
    -When u storing the critical value: encrypt it while it is stored in the database
