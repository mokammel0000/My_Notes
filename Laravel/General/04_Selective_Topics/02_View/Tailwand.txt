In the last version of laravel, it replaced bootstrap and used Tailwind, 
    so any thing is related to Views will displayed as Tailwind format. 
    
    
What if I depened on Bootstrap on my project?
    but bootstrap still work, if u write it's configurations in 
        [App/provider/Appserviceprovider/write'Paginator::useBootstrapFour();'in the boot method].
        [App/provider/Appserviceprovider/write'Paginator::useBootstrapFive();'in the boot method].
