Writing Php and Laravel in the html design...
    eg.
        href="{{ url('/login/') }}"
        <p> {{ $user()->name }} is @php($age += 15) in the time is {{ time() }}</p>


In blade Template: 
    {{   }}
        -showing the php code in them as it is, don't read html tags in it.
        -scaping the html elements that's written in it.
        -show the code in it as a text, don't convert it to html code...

    {!! !!}
        --showing the php code and convert and extract html tags from it.
        -doesn't scape the html elements that's written in it.
        -show the html code that exist in it
        
        By default, Blade {{ }} statements 
        are automatically sent through PHP's htmlspecialchars function to prevent XSS attacks.
        If you do not want your data to be escaped, you may use the following syntax:
        Hello, {!! $name !!}.
