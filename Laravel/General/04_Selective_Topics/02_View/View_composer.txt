if u want to put a specific view in more than one page(Header for example), 
    it's difficult to pass the data to the view from several controllers. 
    the best solution is to compose the data with the view itself,
    in this case any time that the view will be needed, it will fetch it's data automatically using view composer.



Steps:
    once in the project: 
    1- create '\app\Providers\ViewServiceProvider',
        -u don't have to create ViewServiceProvider, u can use any service provider, 
            but it's better to make a new customized one.
    2- add the ViewServiceProvider to the '\config\app' to force laravel dealing see it.
    3- create '\app\View\Composers' to add the your files in.

    For each view: 
    1- make the view in a specific file.
    2- write the logic(fetching the data) in the composer file,
    3- link the composer file in ViewServiceProvider file to enable laravel reading it.
