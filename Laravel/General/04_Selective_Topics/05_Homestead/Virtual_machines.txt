PHP Internal Server [built-in web server]: 
    it's added to php in the last versions, 
    u can run your php code, without any need of an external server(not even apache).

    use it to test your php project before upload it into host, 
    it's domain is: localhost:8000 = 127.0.0.1:8000, 
    note that: it can't run mysql queries, so u have to run Mysql on xampp.
    it's a bit complicated to use it using native php,
    It's prefer to use it by laravel (just one command: php artisan serve).

Virtual Box:
    Is an Virtual machine that u can instal Virtual OS using it, 
    it's from Oracle, 
    Vmware is better than it, but Virtual Box is [Free].

Vmware:
    Is an Virtual machine that u can instal Virtual OS using it. 

Parallels
    Is an Virtual machine that u can instal Virtual OS using it. 
    To use the Parallels provider, you will need to install Parallels Vagrant plug-in. It is free of charge,
        (it's a plug-in to link Parallels with Vagrant).



Vagrant: (use it)
    Vagrant is an open-source software tool used for creating and managing virtual development environments,
    It provides a simple and streamlined way to set up and configure virtual machines (VMs) for development purposes.
    It works with popular virtualization platforms such as VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V.

    
    Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.
        -With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation,
        -Vagrant lowers development environment setup time,
        -increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
but after u installing a virtual OS using the virtual machine program,
    u have to install the whole environment to run laravel code, 
    u need to install -php -mysql -apache (or any other localhost server).

Then u should to use [HOMESTEAD]:
    It's a laravel package that install all u need to run laravel project.
    Homestead will install the whole laravel environment in your virtual machine(Vagrant is recommended).
    After using Homestead, u can run the laravel project on it as a localhost,
    then u can use your main OS, to deal with the website as a cleint, this is what happenning in the real applications.
    

[I think that: when u installing Homestead, it install laravel environment in both the main and virtual OS], 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If u want to use docker, u can use [Laravel Sail] instead of using Homestead.
    It's a laravel package that install all u need to run laravel project, 
    [but is's dependent on Docker Container]
