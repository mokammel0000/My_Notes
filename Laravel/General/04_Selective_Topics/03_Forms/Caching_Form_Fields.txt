When laravel find an error in the inputs(during the validation process), 
    it back you to the form, and caching it's fields,
    then you can use them in the helper method old().

but what if you want to cach the fields unless there is no error occured?!
there are 2 cases: 
    1- if you return a view: 
        write request()->flash(); to cach the old form fields with the current view.

    2- if you redirect to a specific Route: 
        write redirect->withInput(); to cache the old form fields with the current Route.

        [Then you can use old() method in the form].
