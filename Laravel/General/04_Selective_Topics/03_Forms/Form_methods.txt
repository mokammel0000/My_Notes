GET|HEAD: 
    -Fetch the data from the server to show it in the cleint side.
    -any traditional link (a) is considered as a get route.
    -Returning some data, or returning a View.

POST
    -Sending data to the server.


DELETE
    -Deleting data from the server.


PUT| PATCH
    -Uploading data to the server(photo| file).


in the HTML forms: there is no DELETE or PUT methods,
    so make it POST method and then use the @method('DELETE') to inform route that it isn't a traditional POST.

DELETE AND PUT methods are new standardes of http protocol,
    if u want to ignore them, do it, and make form post as it is, 
    but in this case you can't use category resource...
