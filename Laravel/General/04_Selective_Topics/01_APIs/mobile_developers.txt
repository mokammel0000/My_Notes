When u want to return some data to mobile developers: 
    If u return the whole Model in the response, 
        1- size of API will be so big, it's consume much time to transfer to him, 
        2- Mobile Application will be heavey because it contains data that it don't need.

    so, u must return just data that he need from the Model.


API Resource: 
    is to send just data that the mobile developer need, 
    send some fields from the DB(not all fields), 
    also u can name fields as u want(You are not forced to use DB names).


Conditional Attributes: 
    u can put some conditions on the fields, sometimes it will be sent, and other times it won't.
