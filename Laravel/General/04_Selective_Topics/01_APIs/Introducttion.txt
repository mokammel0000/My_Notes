when we use Continous Websites, there was no need to what's called APIs.
    but now, we need to use the data that returned from backend in many applications, 
    now the there are many faces to the Cleint such as(website - mobile - IOT device - etc...), 
    and each one can use data that's returned from backend in it's own way.
    

When the Data returns from Controller: 
    Javascript can take it to deal with.
    Mobile Developer can take it to deal with.
    Any smart device can take it to deal with.
    Any other model(eg. machine learning) can take it to deal with.

so how can u transfer data from backend to different systems(frontend - Mobile - IOT devices - etc...)
    u can't return a php array, other languages will not understand it, 
    so, u must return data in a standard format, so any one of them can understand it, and deal with it in it's way, 
    the standard format is JSON[JSON standes for Javascript Object Notation].


From the previous introduction, u can return one of the three things from the controller: 
1- Returning [single value]
    integer, string, and we will deal with it from the frontend.

2- Returning [view]
    if u worked on a continous website, that's backend is connected to the frontend.

3- Returning API Response
    returns JSON format, 
    use [Eloquent/API Resource] to format returned json file into the format u need, 
    (u can return data in multiple formats such as: numbers - dates - names - etc...)
