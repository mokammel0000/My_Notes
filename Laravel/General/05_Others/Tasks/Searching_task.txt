before u code the searching task code, please think for these: 
    -what is the columns that u should search in them? 
    -is the text on the website important in searching task? are u a search engine?!
    -Specify what is your scope,
    -Specify what is the users goal that he will search about,

    -don't search in all columns in all tables in the DB,
    -and don't search in all text in the website, 
        that's will make the task harder for u(how can write such a complex query?!!)
        also will consume time and memory to perform this task in the users view.
