To Create a cart in an e-commerce application, u can perform this task using one of the 3 ways: 

1- store cart products in [User's Session]: 
    this way is depended on the traditional cart that we use in the supermarkets, 
    we fill our cart with products, the cart belonges to it's customer while he is in the supermarket, 
    then he can buy what he collect, or go out and leave the cart to the workers to fill it out.

    in this way the cart is temproray, and any time user left the website it will be empty when he back to it.

2- Store cart products in [User's Cookies]: 
    this way has some drawbacks like: 
        -user can delete or change these data, it's stored on it's browser.
        -u can't store any data types in the Cookies other than strings, 
            u can't store complex data structures and not even arrays, we can avoid this problem using some tricks.
            [Sessions can store data structures].
        -it's also not permenant, it's stay a specified period of time, and then deleted automatically.
        -also it's not a secure way, it's on user's machine, so it can be under attack at any time.


3- The best way to store Cart products is to store them in DB, 
    -permenant way.
    -can't be modified from any one.
    -secure way.
    -can store any data at an organized way.
