Relative path: 
    A relative path describes the location of a file relative to the current (working) directory.
    If the current file position changes, this path will not work with it, 
    Changes when u want to go to the same file from 2 different files.

An absolute:
    Path describes the location from the root directory.
    If the current file position changes, this path will still work
        because it's not depended on the current file position, 
    Doesn't change when u want to go to the same file from 2 different files, 
        because we use the same start point
            [each file must reach to the start point then go through the absolute path].

url('path'):  generate the full qualified path to any route
    give u the website domain, and u write the whole route.
    [The start point is the domain of the website, so write the rest of the route after the '/' ]
    [the APP_URL is written in the .env file to inform url() with it.] 
    eg. 
        url('/product/'.$product->id);
        url("/product/$product->id");
        url("/product/{$product->id}");  #THE BEST WAY

asset('path'):  generate the full qualified path to any folder in public folder.
    reach u to the public folder to reach to the css, javascript, fonts, images.
        note that: public folder is open to all pages that them can access to it,
            so don't put an important files/ images in it. 
    [The start point is the public folder, so write the rest of the files hierarchy ].
    eg. 
        asset('assets/css/style.css')
        asset('assets/js/custom.js')
        asset('uploads/Products/image-placeholder-base.png')
