CSRF is one of the security ways that laravel will provide to developers, 
    when a user submit a form, it will be submited using a specific number, 
    and laravel will generate the same number in user's session, 
    if the number that's send from user side is the same number that's stored in the session, 
    then accept this request.

    if the number isn't the same number, then this is not the original user that's submitted the form, 
    this is a hacker who stole the data from the form, and want to sumbit it to chage some user's data.



You can stopped it using Middleware.
