using the auth() helper function,
    which also provides access to the authentication service.
    The auth() helper function is a global helper available throughout your Laravel application
        and is commonly used to interact with the authentication service.

auth()->user()->id;    // can write any attribute in the user's table(email - phone - created_at - etc...)
    -fetch the name of the current user(from the user object, fetch his name attribute).

auth()->id();
    -directly fetch the id of the current user.

using the [Auth facade], 
    which is a static proxy to the underlying authentication service.
    The Auth facade provides a convenient way to access authentication methods
        without explicitly resolving the underlying service instance.
        It's a shorthand way of accessing the authentication service.

Auth::attempt($credentials);    
    -take this email and password and check if there are authenticated to login or not.
    -if they are authenticated, perform what is in if statement(like go to your profile).

Auth::check();
    -check if the user has logged in or not.

Auth::user();
    -fetch the object of the current logged user in this session.

Auth::user()->name;     // can write any attribute in the user's table(email - phone - created_at - etc...)
    -fetch the name of the current user.
