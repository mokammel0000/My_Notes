    APP_KEY: Laravel use it to encrypte and decrypte Encrypted Files, Sessions, Cookies and Cached Fiels, 
        so if you change it, you Can't return the Origianl Data.

    One-Way Process 
    If you hash any object, you can't return it to the original value, [but you can compare it with others].
