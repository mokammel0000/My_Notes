1- Composing The Blade Design:      جهز التيمبلت الي هتشتغل عليه
   -put css, javascript, fonts and images in the assets in the public folder
                                       (next to index file/ accessable to user),
      so u can reach to them from any page in the website using absolute path(asset('path')).
   -create the master layout in the views, and then compose other views(extends, section, yeilds).

2- Create DB Scheme and add it's name in the .env file

3- Specify the TASK that u will start with(e.g Categories Task), 
   Specify the REQUIRMENTS of this Task
   Create the TABLE SCHEME on the paper or using (laravel Scheme Design)

4- Make the Migration and Model for the table.
            DDL            DML

5- Specify each action should be done,
   Specify if it will be get or post, 
   Create it's ROUTE, 
    -also u can create resource route
    -u can give a name to the route, to call it easialy
   Create it's Controller(contains the functions that belongs to a specefic task)
    -if it was a complete CRUD make a resource controller, and make a resource controller for it.

   Put the route link in the blade template,
   Finish it's function in the controller, and redirect to the view or return to other view.


View/ Url >>> Route >>> Controller(action) >>> View
                        -can use Model

When u want to create any form in the view, specify what is it's form method?
   to create it's correct route...
Note that: the traditional link(a) always be a [get] route, because usually we don't send data using it
   (we can send unimportant data with it in the route itself,
   but we can't store a form or upload files using it).
