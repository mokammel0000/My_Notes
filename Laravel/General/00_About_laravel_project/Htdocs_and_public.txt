HTACCESS: 


HTDOCS:
    is the public folder in xampp virtual server, 
    public folder means that it's accessable to all users,
    [any files out this file will not be able to see for them.]

    so we put server files out of the htdocs account.


public Folder in laravel: 
    contain all the folder's that's must be accessable by the user, 
    [css, javascript, images, fonts, favicon, index.php]
    the index.php file is the entry point for all website routes, so it must be added in the public folder.

    anything that's related to DB or actions that's been calculated, put it outside public.
