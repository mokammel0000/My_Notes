Config Folder: 
    contain metadata about the project, like: (DB - sessions - auth - cach - etc...)
    u can change data in it, but it's not prefer doing that,
        it's uploaded to the server with the project files, so users can reach to it's informations. 
    the best way to change metadata is to change it in .env file.


.env File:
    isn't uploaded into the server, so users can't reach to the informations in it.
    if it wasn't exist in the project/ or some informations has been deleted from it:
        laravel will use data in the Config Folder.
