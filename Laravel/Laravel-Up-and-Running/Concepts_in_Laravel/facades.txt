Laravel facades: 
    A way to interact with the underlying components of the Laravel framework 
    through a simple and expressive syntax,
    providing a static interface to classes managed by the service container.


use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

Log::info('This is an informational message.');

In this example, Log::info is a facade for the Illuminate\Log\Logger class.
    Laravel automatically resolves the underlying instance from the service container and calls the info method on it.

    The facade provides a convenient and expressive way to work with the logging functionality
    without needing to manage the class instance yourself.
