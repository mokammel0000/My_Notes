The essential function of any web application framework is to take requests from a user and deliver responses, usually via HTTP(S).

MVC: 
    Model: represents an individual database table (or a record from that table).
    View:  represents (the template) that outputs your data to the end user. 
    Controller: takes HTTP requests from the browser,
                gets the right data out of the database and other storage mechanisms,
                validates user input,
                and eventually sends a response back to the user.


The HTTP Verbs: 

    Get: 
    HEAD:
    Post: 
    Put:
    PATCH:  
    Delete: 
    OPTIONS: 
    TRACE:   >never used in normal web development
    CONNECT: >never used in normal web development
