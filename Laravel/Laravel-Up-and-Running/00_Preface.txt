what is this book about:
    -Its primary purpose is to provide developers with a high-level overview and concrete examples
    to learn what they need to work in any Laravel codebase with any and every Laravel feature and subsystem.
    
    -Understanding the foundational concepts behind Laravel.

How This Book Is Structured: 
    -the early chapters cover the foundational components you’ll need to get started,
    and the later chapters cover less foundational or more esoteric features.

    -Each section of the book can be read on its own, 
    but for someone new to the framework, I’ve tried to structure the chapters so that
    it’s actually very reasonable to start from the beginning and read until the end.
