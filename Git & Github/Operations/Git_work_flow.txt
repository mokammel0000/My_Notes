Git Work flow means how we can organize dealing with a git repo.

Main Branch always must be completed, we can't merge an uncompleted Branches into the main.
    then if u want to deploy the project, u will not deploy uncompleted tasks.

Each programmer work in any task, should make a new branch to upload his updates on it, 
    after he completed this task, teamleader will merge it to the main and resolve Conflicts.
