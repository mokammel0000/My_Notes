Git:
    -Version Controll: to trace your old versions
                        -knowing the content in each one,
                        -can replace any current version with an older stable one.
                        
    -help u in Team Work: 
        push your updated, and pull your project-mates updates, and merging each other in one project, 
        (it's better than using a hard drive, or sd card that u can't controll conflicts using it).
        
    -can work with any type of data(text, images, vedios, etc..),
        but it's better to use it with text files, 


all past versions of your project, and all objects that related to git will be saved in git folder, 
    so, be carful when u use it, it's better if that u don't touch it.
