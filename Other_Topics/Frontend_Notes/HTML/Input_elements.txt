Any Input Element in html, consider as a variable from the php Perspective. 
    the name of the Element: is the name of the variable.
    the value of the Element: is the value of the variable.
    so, using Input elements u can receive data from user, and send it to backend...


but what if we looped in a specific element, and each loop it add a new value to it,
    if we deal with this element as a variable: we can't store any value expect the last one
        because each one will override the previous value in this variable. 

    so we want to convert the Input Element to an array, so that we can store more than one value in it.


example for an INDEXED array:              name="quantity[]"
    @foreach ($products as $product)
        <input class="input_number" type="text" name="quantity[]" value="{{ $product->pivot->quantity }}">
    @endforeach

    In this case: the input field will be an indexed array in the request() in the backend, 
                some quantities we can't specifiy which one is for whome product....!!!!!!!


example for an ASSOSIATIVE array:          name="quantity[{{$product->id}}]"
    @foreach ($products as $product)
        <input class="input_number" type="text" name="quantity[{{$product->id}}]" value="{{ $product->pivot->quantity }}">
    @endforeach

    In this case: the input field will be an assosiative array in the request() in the backend, 
                the product_id will be the key, and the product_quantity will be the value in this array.
