HTML: (for the structure)
    HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language".
    It describes the structure of a webpage.
    technically, it's not a programming language, you can't write any logic in it.
   
    
    Every HTML tag has some semantic meaning which the browser understands, because HTML is also [standardized].
    Hence there is no guessing about what a <h1> tag means.

    HTML does not include any instructions regarding what the site should look like (i.e. how it should be described).
    It really only defines the structure and tells the browser:which content is a heading,
    which content is an image, which content is a paragraph etc.
    This is especially important for accessibility,
    screen readers get all the useful information out of the HTML structure.

CSS: (for the styling)
    CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets").
    CSS is all about adding styling to the website. That is done via [CSS rules].


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript:  (for dynamic content)
    It's actually is a programming language.

    It's not always visible but, It's resposible for [all dynamic content you find on a website],
    It's basically responsible for everything that changes in the browser after the page has been loaded.

    (e.g. tabs, overlays etc.) is actually only possible because of JavaScript.
    It allows web developers to define code that runs in the browser (not on the server),
    hence JavaScript can be used to change the website whilst the user is viewing it.

Conclusion: 
    Html and Css generate -let's say- a template that represent a static webpage without any reactions, 
    Html and Css are necessary to complete the page loading process.
    then JavaScript make components change after the page has been realoaded.
