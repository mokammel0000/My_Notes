SPA is stands for: Single Page Application, 

    in the traditional websites, each web page is accessed via a specific Route, 
        then, when you want to open any page, it will be realoaded for you.

    in SPA, all the website is accessed via the same Route,
        so you can move between pages without reload any one of them
        (they have been reloaded just once, in the first time that you opened the website).

        
    each web page is considered as a component, so you can use it in any other application.
    it depends on AJAX, 
    it has an amazing features, 

    it devide the web Application to [COMPONENTS], 
        each componenet has it's own code(html - css - javascript), 
        that's facilitate move it to other website if u need it.
