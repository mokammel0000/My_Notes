AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page[WITHOUT INTERRUPTING THE WEB PAGE].
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX benifits: 
    -doesn't reload the whole page in every click,
    / doesn't reload the whole page and download assets at every click.
        so it is an important feature specilly for the users who have a bad internet speed.
    -give a comfortable trial for users(make the website as the mobile app, don't reload the page in every click).

The traditional html->php page:
    Html send data to php using it's inputs, and then php make some processing on the data,
        and then return view, or redirect u to the last view after refresh the page. 
    
    The default behavior that the link or the form is sending data to a specific route,
        and then the controller deals with this data to perform a specific task,
        and then return a view or redirect to the same view with refreshing all the data in it.

Using ajax: 
    JavaScript will control the html elements,
        -take the data from them,
        -sent it to the route(to perform the backend operations),
        -then make some changes on the same view(without reload it).

    
    Ajax itself will send the data to the route, then the task will be acheived in the backend, 
    but the difference is: ajax will do some code in success/ error cases, you can refresh just a spesific element, 
    or change some values on the web page without refresh all the web page.
    also if u use ajax to delete some elements in the web page,
    use some animations to delete it/them with a good style...


You can make an ajax requests using one of there three ways: 
    1- Native JavaScript: writing a huge blocks of code...

    2- Fetch API: package in JavaScript, that deal with Ajax.

    3- Jquery: A huge library, that contains thousands of functions to facilitate coding with JavaScript. 
        [[some of it's functions is dealing with ajax]].

    4- AXIOS: the most famous library to deal only with AJAX.


To write an AJAX Code in Jquery write it in this form: 

    $('#add-to-cart-form').submit(function(e){    // firstly hold the element that will send the data using ajax
    e.preventDefault();                           // prevent it's default behavior.
    // the last 2 lines was't ajax code, it's a jquery code...

        $.ajax({
            url: '/add-to-cart', 
                // the url that ajax will send data to...
            method: 'POST',  
                // the method of the url.
            data: ,
                // the data that will send to the url.
            success: function(data){;
            },
                // the code that will perform in the success status.
            error: function(){      
            }
                // the code that will perform if any error occurs.
        })

    });
