Css Best Practice: 
    try the styles that u want in the developer tool, when u reache your goal, go to edit the main code...

Grid: 
    is an old way to organize the web site page, 
    it devide the page into 12 columns

Flex: 
    is the best way now to organize the web pages designs.

Styles Periorities: 
    1- Inline Style.
    2- Internal Style.
    3- External Style.

    but you can give a property to the Internal style that is 'IMPORTANTA',
        so it will take more piriority than the Inline Style.
    In this case, if u want to activate the Inline style, give it the same property('IMPORTANTA),
        or remove it from the Internal style.
    so if u write an inline style and it doesn't work, make it 'IMPORTANTA'.



Bootstrap usually user classes: 
    class="mt-5"
    class="text-center"
    class="justify-content-center"

    .row>.col-3 (to put the element in one of 4 parts of the screen)
                you can add 3 columns beside this div...
