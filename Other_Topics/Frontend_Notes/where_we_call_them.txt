In most web pages, we call css sheets at the [head],
wheres we call the javascript code at the end of the body...
    why we do that?

Html and css are responsible for displaying the content in the web page, 
    so it's necessary to display them at the begining of the page, 
    
wheres javascript is responsible for change the components of the page, 
    so we must call it after we call all the components...


if you want to write a code at the begin or at the middle of the web page, 
    write it in this way: 

    -In JavaScript: 
    window.load = function(){
        // the code here will NOT be executed unless the whole page will be downloaded...
    }


    -In Jquary: 
    $(function(){
        // the code here will NOT be executed unless the whole page will be downloaded...
    });
    $() = window.load = 


    -other way using Jquary: 
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // the code here will NOT be executed unless the whole page will be downloaded...
    });
