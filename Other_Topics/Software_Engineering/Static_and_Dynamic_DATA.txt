Static Data: 
    data that is usually stable, it not changed alot of times,
    e.g. Your Data of the Facebook account, 
        it's Stored once, and you Not change it every day

    in this Type of data, It's easy to cache it,
        but when you try to change it, the application will ask you to restore it(to cache the new ones).



Dynmic Data: 
    data that's changing over the time, 
    you can't cache it, as it's changing rate is big, 
    when you try to change it, the application will NOT be restored as it sends it's query to the DB to fetch the newest one frequently.
    e.g. Mobile Balance
