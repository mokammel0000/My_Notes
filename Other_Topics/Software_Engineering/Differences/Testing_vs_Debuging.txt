Testing: 
    Are there any errors? 
    In this stage we don't care with the reason for the error,
                  we don't care with the line that is placed in, 
                and we don't care with solving it, 
                [Just care about finding different Errors].


Debugging: 
    What is the reason for the error, where is the line that's caused it, and how can we fix it?


there is a type of testing is called [Defect Testing]: 
    It cares with Discovering Bugs that causes the errors.
