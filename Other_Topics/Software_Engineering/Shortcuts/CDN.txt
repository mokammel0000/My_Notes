CDN:
    stands for: Content Deliver Network
    the Normal behavoir for using an external package/ plugin/ website
        is to download it's source code in your project, and then call it.

    Using CDN, you can do this process without download the source code, 
    [Link your project with the source code via Internet]
    but be careful, if you want to use the project offline it won't work,
        because project can NOT see the source code.
    also using CDN will make your project a bit slower.

When it's prefer to use CDN? 
    -when you want to try something before
        (to make sure if it will be suitable to use this package or not).

    -when you use the package in very small range in your project,
        and it's will be overwhealming if you download the whole package for this small section
        (specially if the package source code was big).
