1- Exhaustive Testing: 
    try all possible inputs that's user can use...
    it's an Exhausting process to do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- Test Driven Development(TDD): 
    usually used in Incremental Development, 
    when you finish any increment, test it.
    [Inter-leaved Testing and Development Processes].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3- Regression Testing: 
    When you finish any increment, test it and all the previous increments
        sometimes when you add a new feature it can harm the previous ones,
        or may be some conflicts between merge two features with each others.
    [Make ensure that each part of the project can't harm the previous work]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4- Performance Testing: 
    Is the System Stable? 
    What is it's Speed?
    What is it's Resorce Usage?
    if we try to double users on the system, will it work?
    What is it's Reliability?
    What is it's Scalability القابلية للتوسع?
    What is it's Reliability ? 

    # There are specific websites that can measure the performance for your systems(called Profiles)

5- Black-Box Testing and White-Box Testing: 

    Black-Box Testing:
    Is this system conforms the requirments of not
    (in this type we don't care with the implementation, we care with the last outputs)

    White-Box Testing: 
    it has several names, like: glass testing, Structural testing, open-box testing, clear-box testing...
    Care with the implementation,
    you calculate Statements Coverage: -unused Statements
                                       -Unreachable Code.
                                       -Unused Branches.
