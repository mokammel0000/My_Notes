Solving Problems by Searching can be done in 2 ways: 

1- Un-informed Search:   g(n)
    -problem formulation
    
    -Examples:
        BFS
        UCS
        DFS
        DLS 
        IDS
        BS 

2- Informed Search 
    -Optimization Algorithms
    -Heuristic Function is [Required]
    
    -it's devided to 2 categories: 
        
        A- Best First Search 
            Greedy Search h(n)
            A* Search h(n)+f(n)

        B- Local Search (Optimization Algorithms)
            Hill Climbing algorithm 
            Genetic algorithm
