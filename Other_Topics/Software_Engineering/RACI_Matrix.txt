        They are the "doers" who carry out the activities.

    Accountable (A):
        The person who is ultimately accountable and has the authority to make decisions.
        This person ensures that the task is completed successfully.

    Consulted (C):
        Individuals or groups who need to be consulted before a decision is made or before the task is completed.
        They provide input and feedback but are not ultimately responsible for the task.
        
    Informed (I):
        Individuals or groups who need to be kept in the loop about the progress of the task
            but are not directly involved in its execution.
