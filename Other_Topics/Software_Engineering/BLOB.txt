How can we store a file in our Database: 

---The Traditional way to store any file in the DB tables: 
    -If it was a text file, store it as it is.
    -If it was a multi-media file: 
        1- Upload it to your server in a specific folder
        2- Store it's link(it is a text) in the table.

    In this way, there are multiple drawbacks: 
        1- If the Folder has been deleted, all the uploads will NOT be exist.
        
        2- If the name of the file has been changed, we can't reach to it(although it still exists).
        3- If you want to change the old file, you will upload the new one and put it's name, 
            [who will remove the old one??!]
        4- If you want to make a Comparison between 2 files, it will be an aggressive process
            you have to go to each link and compare it's file with the others...
        5- If you're working in a microserveses System,
            if the folder was in a specific machine and it's broken for any reason, 
            [Other systems can NOT reach to the file].



---A second way: 
    store the file in the table, in a column that's type is: BLOB
    (it will convert the file data to a binary format, and store it)
    
    this way will solve the problems in the previous one
        (all the problems that assosiated with seperate data from it's table)
    in this way each record will contain all it's data(text data and multi-media files)


    but this way also has some drawbacks: 
        1- the query size will be so large (espetially if you use a query like select *)
            it will consume big time to retreive all the records.
        2- also if you want to search in the DB, it will consume a big time,
            each record will contain a big data,
                then search-engine will be slow to move between different records.
