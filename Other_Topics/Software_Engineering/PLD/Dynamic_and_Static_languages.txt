Dynamic Vs. Static languages.
    Statically Typed Language: 
        each variable must have it's own type during COMPILE TIME, 
        so, in the RUN TIME each variable know what is the values can be stored in.

    Dynamically Typed Language: 
        there is no type is declared to the variable during COMPILE TIME, 
        so, in the RUN TIME each variable can hold any value.
        -this is a good option, but it can make unexpected errors...
