Compilation: 
    -Faster.
    -Translate all the code to the Assembly, then execute all of it.
    -Used in Large systems.
    -Included JIT Systems(Translate what Only what it needed not all the code).


Interpretation: 
    -Slower than Compiler (10 to 100).
    -Easier in Programming.
    -don't need to translate all the code, it execute line by line.
    -examples: Javascript, PHP, APL, Lisp and Perl.


Hybrid: 
    Translate all the code to Assembly language(as a compiler), 
    then execute it line by line (as an Interpreter).
