"enum" stands for "enumeration." It is a data type that represents a set of [named values],
    also known as enumerators or constants.
    
Enums are used to define a collection of related values that have a specific meaning or purpose.

The primary purpose of enums is to improve code readability and maintainability
    by providing a way to define a set of named values that are semantically meaningful.
    Instead of using arbitrary values or strings to represent different states or options,
    enums allow programmers to use descriptive names.
