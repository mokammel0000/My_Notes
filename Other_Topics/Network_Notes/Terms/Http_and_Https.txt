HTTP 
    Stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol.

    Is a standardized protocol which defines what a request and response has to look like,
    standardized how a request and response should look like,
    [which data may be included, and in which form, and how the request will be submitted].

    in Http data will send as it is, any hacker can snife it in network will understand it.

HTTPS:
    It's like HTTP but encrypted. Most modern pages use that instead of HTTP, 
    It encryptes data from the user, and decrypts when it reachs to the server, 
    So cleint and server only can decrypts data,
    So, any hacker sniffing data in the network can't know the meaning of it.
