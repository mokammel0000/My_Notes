Each network in the world has a unique IP address, servers networks also have an IP address, 
    Servers store  websites,
    so you can access any website just by knowing it's server's IP address.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But there are a problem, One server has the capability of storing several websites,
    and if the server consists of multiple websites, 
    all the websites cannot be accessed with the server's IP address.

    In such cases additional pieces of information [Host Headers] are used to
        uniquely identify the website in the choosed server.

    However, for the giant web sites like Facebook.com or YouTube.com,
        the entire data center infrastructure will be dedicate to the storage of it's particular website.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is difficult for a person to remember many IP addresses,
    so we can use [domain names] like youtube.com, facebook.com etc 
    -which are corresponding to server's IP addresses- to facilitate reaching to these servers
    
Domanin names are easier for us to remember than the long sequence of numbers.
    So to access internet we always use domain names instead of the complex IP address numbers.
    From where does the internet get IP addresses corresponding to our domain name requests???!

For this purpose the internet uses a huge phone book known as [DNS].
    If you know a person's name, but don't know their telephone number,
    you can simply look it up in a phone book.

DNS servers: 
    is stands for (Domain Name System servers).
    special type of servers out there in the internet,
    not just one but they are many servers of that type.

    The job of these DNS servers is to translate domains to IP addresses.
    You can imagine those servers as huge dictionaries
        that store each Domain and it's corresponding IP adderss.

[The DNS server provides the same service to the internet]

Your internet service provider or other organizations can manage the DNS server.

You enter the domain name, the browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the corresponding IP address.
    After getting the IP address, your browser simply forwards the request to the server,
    then server will response to you using your IP address.
