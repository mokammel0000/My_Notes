How can data transfere between different devices?
    Once the server gets a request to access a particular website, data flow starts,
        
    Data is transferred in digital format via [optical fiber cables],
    more specifically in the form of [light pulses].

Light pulses:
    sometimes have to travel thousands of miles via the optical fiber cable to reach their destination.
    During their journey they often have to go through tough terrains such as hilly areas or under the sea.


Optical Fiber Cables:
    -The complex optical cable network is the [backbone of the Internet].
    -Carrying the light are stretched across the seabed(قاع البحر) to your doorstep(عتبة باب بيتك)
    where they are connected to a router.

    The router converts these light signals to electrical signals.
        An Ethernet cable is then used to transmit the electrical signals to your laptop.

    However if you are accessing the Internet using cellular data,
        from the optical cable the signal has to be sent to a cell tower,
        and from the cell tower the signal reaches your cell phone in the form of electromagnetic waves.

    
There are a few global companies who lay and maintain these optical cable networks
    (like Google, Orange, AT&T, Verizon).
