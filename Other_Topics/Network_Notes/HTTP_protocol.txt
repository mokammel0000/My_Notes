What is HTTP protocol:
    Stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    Tell us how the web works.
    HTTP is the messenger in the web.
    The most used [internet] protocol in the world.
    It's defined by a set of precise rigorous rules.

    HTTP is a tcp/ip based application layer protocol,
        that allows web based applications to communicate and exchange data.

    Computers that's communicate via the HTTP must speak the HTTP protocol.

    We use the HTTP protocol,
        because it is a convenient way to quickly and reliably move data on the web 

    
    It is an [application layer] protocol,
        that allows web based applications to communicate and exchange data.

    It is tcp/ip based protocol and it is used to deliver contents (eg. images, videos, audios, documents, etc).
    
    Servers and Cleints must communicate with each other using HTTP protocol.

    HTTP was created first to fetch HTML documents and sends it back to the client,
    so we can say that the HTTP was designed for the web in the first place,
    that's all what the HTTP was doing in the 1991, 
    and it didn't support other media types [just delivering HTML documents].
    
    But because it was designed in an exquisite way,
    and it was being continually evolved with amazing features were being added to it,
    it became the most convenient way to quickly and reliably move data on the web, 
    It has alot of amazing features.

Three Important Things about HTTP protocol[HTTP protocol features]: 
    1-HTTP can deliver any sort of data as long as the two computers are able to read it.
    2- HTTP protocol is a [connectionless protocol]:
        The computers that communicate via the HTTP -as we said in a request response cycle-
        after making the request, the two computers disconnects from each other,
        and when the response is ready the connection reestablishes again to deliver the response, then it closes.

    
    
    3-HTTP protocol is a [stateless protocol] 
        the client and server know about each other just during the current request,
        if the connection closes completely and the two computers want to connect again,
        they need to provide information to each other again, and the connection is handled as the very first one.

    -there are other important things in features about the HTTP.

How the Internet Works: 
    To make any 2 devices in the world being connected with each other,
        you have to put a physical cable, that's connected the 2 devices with each others, 
        [That's what is internet doing], 
        Internet mean that we put all devices in a one network, to enable communicating between them. 

        But it's necessary to use some protocols(like TCP/IP protocol),
            to organize the connection between different devices,
        
        So, the job of the internet using the tcp/ipsuite of protocols:
            is to establishes the connection using a combination of cable media and wireless media,
            and do all the necessary work to prepare the environment for the two computers to talk 


How the web works using HTTP protocol [Request-Response-cycle]:
    after a physical connection has been established between different devices (using internet and it's protocols),
        
    How can we Transfer data(either html web pages, or other types of data...) between them ?!!

    [Via the HTTP protocol],
    When cleint wants to send request to the server: 
        1- The connection establishes,
        2- The client sends a request called an HTTP message
            -and because the HTTP is a connectionless protocol
            the client disconnects from the server waiting for the response-
        
    The server on the other side: 
        1- process the request,
        2- prepare the response,
        3- establishes the connection again
        4- and send back the response again in form of an HTTP message to the client.

    then the two computers completely disconnect from each other until there was a new connection need to establish, 
    they will establish a new completely connection.

HTTP is a protocol it is defined by a set of precise rigorous rules:

HTTP Messages consists of three main sections 
    1- [THE START LINE] it's located on the top of the message.
    2- [THE HEADERS] it's on the middle of the message.
    3- [THE BODY] it's located at the buttom of the message. 
    
    The three sections contain plaintext information -unless if the body contains binary data-
    but in general HTTP messages are plain text and easy to read.
    
    The information in the three sections very dependent on the HTTP message
    -whether it is a request or a response-
    A request HTTP message differs from a response one.


    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The components of the HTTP request in the case of [Request HTTP message]: 
    1- [The start line contains]:
        -[The method] GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc...:
            The method is a sort of command from the client,
            It tells the server what it should do,
                for example -give me data -delete this -put this in the database.
        
                there are two well-known HTTP methods:
                1- GET: tell the server to send you the data(displaing a web page on the browser).
                2- POST: to tell it to store data in the database.
                and there are others such as put delete etc, 


        -[The URI] complete path or the request:
            The URI Uniform Resource identifier:
                URI is a set of readable characters,
                in a way to locate the resources we are requesting from the server
                for example in our case is "products/myproducts.HTML".


        -[The HTTP version] what is the http version that the cleing use? eg. 1, 2, etc...:
            HTTP version that the client is using,
            so that the server understands the message well 
        

    2- [The headers] specifies some information in rules:
        are basically name value pairs and there can be a lot of headers
        -The host:
            The address of the server to which we are sending the request (like www.cms.gov.com).

        -Accept:
            What are the languages that's cleint can understand (like en-us).

        -Accept language:
            What type of the files that's cleint can request, 
            it holds a miami type has its value (like type/extension).
        

    3- [The Body]: if it's nedded in the request.


    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The components of the HTTP request in the case of [Response HTTP message]: 
    1- [The start line contains]:
        In the response we don't have the method or the URI, we there is no need to them here
        -[The HTTP version] what is the http version that the cleing use? eg. 1, 2, etc...:
            HTTP version that the client is using,
            so that the server understands the message well 

        -[Status Code]:
            This code tells the client if the request succeeded or failed,
            it may contain 200:ok which means the request succeeded,
            or it may contain 404:file not found status code 
            and there are other codes.

            
    2- [The headers]:
        are basically name value pairs and there can be a lot of headers
        -except language.

        -content length.

    3- [The Body]: contains the requested file.
