Network: 
    network is a group of computer systems two or more interconnected together
    for the sake of communicating and exchanging data using lengths
    
    these computer systems whether they're laptops, desktops, smartphones, TVs cars etc 
    are called -in terms of the network- [nodes],
    
    these nodes establish connections between them using 
        either cable media 
        or wireless media.

History of the Internet: 
    in the 1960s Advanced Research Projects Agency [ARPA] of the US Department of Defense 
        funded a research to develop protocols to allow the computers to interconnect with each other
        using digital communication regardless the geographical area
        
        therefore the first network a research network was created the network was used for 
        academic and scientific purposes, it started small connecting a bunch of connected:
        university campuses, research institutions, and companies 
        
        the network grew to a few hundred by the early 1980s,
        at the same time all the networks were being created using other protocols
        
        other networks were being created using other protocols networks such as x.25,Usenet and others
        
    [until now there are many networks(each one use a particular protocol),]
                [but each one is isolated from others].
        

    These networks wanted to interconnect with each other by connecting the networks together
        and in order to successfully interconnect networks must use the exact same protocols
        this problem led to the invention of a global unique suit of protocols called [TCP/IP]. 
        
        Thus the advent of the internet(بداية عصر الإنترنت)
    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Internet: 
    Internet is more than Web...
    Internet = Inter-Network(i.e all are in the same network).

    Internet is a global network of networks 
    -networks that are either private, public, academic, business, government or etc- 
    actually there are millions of interconnected networks out there,
    And that what makes the internet a global network

    Internet is interconnected computers via cables or wireless media,
    using the global [TCP/IP] suite of protocols.
    
    to take advantage of this huge network and make use of it,
    many internet services has been created and engineered such as:
        -mobile apps,
        -electronic mail 
        -file-sharing 
        -the world wide web 
        -online games 
        -Internet telephony , etc
        
        so all these services are built on top of the Internet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web: 
    A web is a general word that's mean every approach that's depened on [cleint-server-approach], 
    whether it was a 
        -website: send request and receive html page,
        -mobile application: send request and receive JSON file,
        -IOT device that sends requests and receive responces from a server.

    Web is means [any interaction] between cleint and server.
    Always the request response pattern is the same,
    but each device requests it's own format, to deal with it.


    when you enter a URL (e.g. "academind.com/learn") into the browser you get a website in return.

    what is the world wide web or (simply the web) 
        The world wide web is probably the most commonly used service on the Internet.
        Let people to search get and share data therefore it's the most influential application in this world.
        
        To be more specific the web is a sort of virtual system that interconnects resources on the Internet
        such as documents images videos and many other resources via hyperlinks and references
        with you our eyes Uniform Resource identifier.
        
        we use web browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, 
            and other similar programs to have access to web resources usually
