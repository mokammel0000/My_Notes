Server 
    Server is simply a program that's run on a powerful computer,
    We called it Server because it's job is to serve cleints(providing them the stored data when they request it).
    
    Server is anything that is ready to handle requests 24*7 as it's connected with the internet all the time.

    Server do the following:
        -responds your Web requests (Apache/Nginx).
        -Processes your data(PHP/Python).
        -handles your database queries(MySQL/MariaDB/Postgres).
    Server is a general word that's we say about all the three components.
    
    If u have ONE machine that u host your website on it, that mean it must have 
    -Web server,    -Application server,      -Database server.
    To handle: 
        -Web requests,  -Application processes,   -Database queries.
    All of these softwares are installed in a same machine and a single machine,

If u want to maximize the uptime and to improve monitoring,
    you will host your database on different machine and call it a [Database server].
    To handle all your database queries.

If u want to maximize your revenue by processing their data which will require too much processing.
    It will increase load on your server that handles your web requests and application processes.
    So, you will host your application on another machine that handle requests from the web server.
    It will become your [Application server],
    The server that is handling your web requests will become your dedicated [Web server].

Now you get better monitoring and can find out bugs and unusual activities on each and every part of your web application.
