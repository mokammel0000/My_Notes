Web is more than just traditional websites 
    It's more than just HTML code getting sent back and displayed on the browser's page,

    If you're having a mobile app,
        you must need some content that's not stored on your device but somewhere in the Internet,
        There you don't actually get back HTML pages that contain this content, 
        but instead [only data] is exchanged.
    
    Web is NOT just mean websites,
        but we basically mean [any interaction] between cleint and server.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The website is stored on some server so
the website you are seeing is a source code that's: 
    
    -either it's code is already stored on the server and is returned back(Static website),
    -or generated dynamically there -generated by the server-(Dynamic Website).
    
your browser is just an interpreter(converts the source code to a user interface).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the general word Website, is devided to 3 main concepts u can,
    here u can see the Differenece between them:

Webpages: (pre-generated HTML pages (e.g. a news page))
    web page is a single document that is written using [hypertext markup language]
        and it's accessible via the web through the internet using a web browser.
    
    Web page might contain text, graphics, hyperlinks to other files.

    We can access the web page by referring to it using a URL (Uniform Resource locator) address using a web browser.

    -[Hypertext] is a text that contains hyperlinks that lead to other documents usually other web pages.

    -[Hyperlink] simply is a text, word, sentence, button, icon, or even a picture, 
        when you click or hover on it you will be directed to another web page.
        

    A group of web pages are not structured and they aren't necessarily interlinking and grouped in one place
    
    There are 2 types of Webpages: 
        Static web page: (there are NO Interactions with DB, Webpage is physically stored in the server)
            It's a document that every time it is requested, it displays the same page on the browser
            Every time u will request this will page, it will return exactly as it is stored in the server
                the place where the document physically exists.

            It doesn't change at all unless if the creator changes it manually
            
            The URL address of a static web page must end with a document extension such as .html or .php 
                if it doesn't then it is not a static web page.


        Dynamic web page: (there are Interactions with DB, Webpage is NOT stored in the server)
            Web pages that are generated using scripting languages and programs,
                interacting with the database on the server side programs.

            It's not stored in the server as it Static one, just it's template is stored in the server, 
                but it's require some data from DB to be ready and then sended to the user.

        
            also, user can update it's content (add - edit - delete)without the Creator intervention 
                -this is important without the Creator intervention- 
            these web pages may change on the fly based on the user action or his computer.

            The URL address of a dynamic web page must NOT end with a document extension such as .html or .php 
                it's routing you to a specific controller, and then returning some view to u.

            for example: The page may contain the current date and time at which you're viewing the web page
                    or the web sites can display your profile information for every different user.

            

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Websites: [Static or Dynamic]
    website is a group of interlinked well-structured web pages that exists on the same domain
        we can shift from page to page using hyperlinks that is to say grouped together in one place.

    Static Website: 
        websites that contains only static web pages.

    Dynamic websites: (less complicated than web applications)
        websites that contains dynamic web pages.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Applications: 
    It is very similar to dynamic web pages requests but they're more complicated.

    It is a software program that exists on the server and runs using a web browser through a web page.
    
    The application is similar to desktop application
        it is created using a combination of programming languages and web application frameworks
    
    It may use RAM and allow user interactivity and it is designed for many uses.
    
    For example Google Mail, Facebook, YouTube, online videoediting and online spreadsheet etc 



    Differenece between Web Applications and dynamic websites:
        Web applications are based on user engagement and almost all their content is from the end user,
        also web applications are similar to desktop applications and there are more complicated
        it need more Skills than websites do. 
        
        Dynamic websites allow the user to interact and add content, 
        but the created content is the dominant and of course they are less complicated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclousion: 
Web pages are single documents that may contain text, graphics etc,
    and they are created using a markup language such as HTML,
    we go to a specific web page by entering its URL address in the web browser.
    
    
Hypertext is a text document that contains links to other text documents.


Websites are a group of well-structured and interlinked web pages and that we move from a page to another page using hyperlinks.
    
    there is two types of websites static and dynamic:
        static websites are displayed to the end-user every time exactly as they are stored on the server 
        dynamic websites however may contain content that is generated on the fly by server-side programs

web applications are server-side software program that is delivered over the Internet through a browser interface
    there are similar to desktop applications that are complicated and are based on user engagement.
