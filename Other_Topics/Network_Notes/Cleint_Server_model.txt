The web is a service which is built on top of the Internet to allow computers to share
    and exchange data easily and reliably,
    and when we say data it can be anything such as images videos documents etc, 
    in any form and for that sometimes the web is referred to as a client-server model communication
    because there are always computers that ask for data which are called clients
    and the computer that gives the data in other words the computer that serves which is the server.


client can be a machine or a program 
    when we say a client's machine we are actually talking about the devices that the end-user can use to
    access the web for example laptop, desktop, smartphones or tablets etc are all clients machines 
    
    on the other hand a client program is a program that allows the user
    to make requests through the web, for example a web browser,word processors or photo editing software,
    have an excess of online resources
    client whether it is a machine or a program is an appliance and a way to make requests through
    
    
server on the other side is a computer program [not a device] a computer program.

    high-performance computers can said to be servers if they're running programs that serve requests
        server contains programs that provide functionality and serve other programs called clients
        they run server operating systems we can run a Windows 10 or a Linux desktop version on a high

    so, high-performance computers are called servers because they run server programs.

    a single server can serve multiple clients at the same time and it runs 24/7 without stopping
    this is why we need actually supercomputers to run such programs
    
    also we can run multiple servers on a one single machine and here we are talking about [virtual servers]

    there are several types of servers 
        -it's one service by doing a specific task for example web servers such as Apache serve HTTP requests 
        -database servers run a database management system such as my Siebel 
        -and other types of servers


    server 
        -can contain web resources 
        -can contain host web applications 
        -can contain source user and program data and do a lot of things 
        -it is used to serve hundreds or thousands of clients 
        -is always listening for requests and as soon as it receives one it responds with a message




client-server model:
    is an architecture on the web that splits computers into two sections
    computers that ask for and requests services and they are called clients
    and computers that serve clients sand they're called servers.
    this architecture is based on [a centralized structure]
    the client-server model works through the request response cycle via [HTTP messages]


peer-to-peer model:
    decentralized one it is the opposite of the client-server model,
    there is no client and no server both computers can be requesters and response providers
    in other words each one of them can be whether a client or a server
    and each computer is functionally identical to the other
    they are able to send and receive data directly with one another
    and both of them can upload or download the information
    and of course they are not required to be connected 24/7
    an example of the peer-to-peer model is BitTorrent or videochat protocols



client is a machine or a program that we use to make requests through the web

server is a program that listens for our requests and respond to them 

the client-server model is a centralized web architecture that classify computers into two
    sections requesters and response providers 
    
and finally there is an alternative for the client-server model which is the peer-to-peer model
    in the peer-to-peer model all computers are functionally equal.
