In windows: 
    Method 1: 
        Change MBR to GPT with a reliable partition tool.
        This is the fastest and easiest way to convert your disk without deleting any partitions or volumes.
        You can use a free software like [EaseUS] Partition Master1.
        Download and install the software, launch it, right-click the MBR disk you want to convert, and choose “Convert to GPT”.
        Then apply the changes and restart your computer.
    
    Method 2:
        Convert MBR to GPT disk with Disk Management.
        This is a built-in tool in Windows 10 that can help you manage your disks and partitions.
        However, this method [requires you to delete all the partitions and volumes on the MBR] disk before converting it to GPT.
        To do this, open Disk Management, right-click the MBR disk, and choose “Delete Volume” for each partition.
        Then right-click the disk again and choose “Convert to GPT Disk”.
        You will need to create new partitions and volumes after the conversion.


In Linux: 
    you need to use a tool that can recognize and manipulate both partitioning schemes.
    One such tool is [gdisk], which is a text-based menu-driven program that can create and modify GPT partitions.
    
    the steps to convert a disk from MBR to GPT using gdisk:
    1-Install gdisk on your Linux system.
        You can use the command [sudo apt install gdisk -y].

    2-List and identify the disks on your system.
        You can use the command [sudo fdisk -l] to see the disk names, sizes, and partition types1.
        Find the disk that you want to convert from MBR to GPT and note its name

    3-Run the gdisk utility on the disk that you want to convert.
        You can use the command sudo gdisk /dev/sda to launch gdisk on the disk /dev/sda (replace it with the correct disk name).
        You will see the current partition table and some options to choose from.

    4-Convert the disk from MBR to GPT.
        You can use the command w to write a new GPT partition table to the disk.
        You will be asked to confirm your choice and warned that this may cause data loss or boot problems.
        If you are sure, press y to proceed. The conversion will take a few seconds and then you will exit gdisk.

    5-Reboot your system and check if everything works fine.
        You may need to reinstall or update your boot loader to make your system bootable with the new GPT partition table.
        You can use the command sudo grub-install /dev/sda to reinstall GRUB on the disk /dev/sda (replace it with the correct disk name).
        You may also need to update your fstab file to reflect the new UUIDs of your partitions.
        You can use the command sudo blkid to see the UUIDs of your partitions and edit the /etc/fstab file accordingly.
