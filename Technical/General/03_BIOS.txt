BIOS: 
    stands for Basic Input/Output System,
    is the [software] that's stored on a chip on a computer's motherboard that runs when you first turn it on.

    BIOS does things like:
        configure the keyboard,
        mouse,
        and other hardware,
        set the system clock,
        test the memory, and so on. 
        
    Then it looks for a drive and [loads the boot loader] on the drive, which is either an (MBR) or (GPT) partition table.

    Usually when you first turn on your computer you will see a logo from either your computer or motherboard's manufacturer.

    Often there's a message below the logo saying which key to press to configure the computer's BIOS.
    This key is usually Delete, Escape, or F2, though it varies by manufacturer.

    As mentioned previously, there are two main types of BIOS: 
        -Legacy BIOS
        -UEFI BIOS.
