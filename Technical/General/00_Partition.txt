A partition is a section of a drive that can be formatted and used for a specific purpose.
A partition is a [virtual division] of a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SSD).

In Windows:
    There is usually a small recovery partition and a large file system partition labeled 'C'.
    'C': partition is what most people are familiar with, as it's where you usually install your programs and store your various files.

In Linux:
    There's typically a root partition (/),
    one for swap which helps with memory management, and large /home partition.
    The /home partition is similar to the C: partition in Windows in that it's where you install most of your programs and store files.
