One way is to use the System Information tool in Windows 10. Here are the steps:

search in windows with “System Information”.
Open the System Information app from the search results.
Look for the “BIOS Mode” entry on the right pane. If it says “UEFI”, then your device supports UEFI.
    If it says “Legacy”, then your device uses BIOS.
