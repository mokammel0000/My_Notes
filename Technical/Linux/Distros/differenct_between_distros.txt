Linux is the kernel (the core part of the operating system), 

Each distribution: 
    Has it's own (softwares),  (libraries),  (package managers),  (desktop environments),  (configurations)
        to create a complete and usable operating system. 

    Is tailored to specific (use cases), (preferences), and (requirements).

    
Differenet between distros can be set in the following:
    [Package Management]
        Different distributions use different package management systems:
        Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu use APT (Advanced Package Tool),
        Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora use RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) and DNF (Dandified YUM).

    [Package Repositories]
        Distributions have their own repositories or software sources where packages are hosted and maintained.

    [Release Cycles]
        Distributions vary in their release cycles: 
        Some distributions have fixed release schedules, such as Ubuntu LTS (Long-Term Support) releases every two years,
        while others like Arch Linux follow a rolling release model with continuous updates.

    [Desktop Environments]
        Different distributions may come with various desktop environments by default.
        For example, Ubuntu uses the (GNOME) desktop environment in its main version,
        while Linux Mint uses (Cinnamon),
        and elementary OS has its (Pantheon) desktop.

    [Configuration and Defaults]
        Each distribution may have different default configurations, themes, and settings.
        This can affect the look and feel of the desktop environment and the behavior of the system.

    [Target Audience]
        Some distributions are designed for specific use cases.
        For example, Kali Linux is focused on penetration testing and cybersecurity,
        while CentOS (now CentOS Stream) has been widely used in enterprise server environments.

    [Community and support] 
        The level of community support and documentation can vary between distributions.
        Popular distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora typically have large and active user communities,
        resulting in abundant online resources and support.

    [Licensing and Philosophy] 
        Some distributions emphasize open-source software and strict licensing policies,
        while others may include proprietary drivers or software to improve hardware compatibility.

    [System Initialization]
        Different distributions may use different system initialization systems.
        For example, some use systemd, while others may use alternatives like OpenRC or Upstart.

    [Filesystem Hierarchy]
        Though most distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS),
        there can be some variations in directory structures or file locations.
