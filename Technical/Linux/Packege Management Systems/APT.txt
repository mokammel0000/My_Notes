            -is considered more user-friendly and straightforward, especially for new users.

            -provides a more concise and human-readable output, making it easier to understand the status of the update process

        [apt-get]: 
            -an older command that uses the traditional APT tool, which some users may find less intuitive.
            -may provide more verbose (مطول) output, which can be useful for more advanced users or scripting but can be overwhelming for some.
